Just as Gruyère is best when holes are embraced, so too must you understand the fundamentals. Loop through, like mice in a fondue pot, variables and types, functions and flow. For without a solid base, your structure may crumble like a wheel of Roquefort.\\n\\n2. **Embrace the Feta of Frameworks**: Just as the tang of feta enhances a salad, so too do frameworks enrich your projects. Seek out Flask or Django, but remember, not all wraps are as tasty; choose those that suit your dish—err, purpose!\\n\\n3. **Mozzarella and Collaboration**: Stretch yourself thin, dear apprentice! Engage with the community through code reviews and open-source galas, for like the finest mozzarella, teamwork adds a delightful pull to your craft.\\n\\n4. **The Manchego of Documentation**: Are your code and its purpose clear? Like a well-aged Manchego, clarity brings richness and depth. Write docstrings that sing and comments that dance, lest your code become a mystery wrapped in an enigma like a wheel of camembert!\\n\\n5. **Continuous Improvement, the Brie of Budding Talent**: Each day, seek a new challenge, a new task—stir the pot of your knowledge until it bubbles over in delight! Embrace problems like a farmer embraces his burgeoning brie fields, for each hurdle is but a chance to hone your skill.\\n\\n6. **Play with the Gorgonzola of Debugging**: Fear not the stinky cheese of mistakes! Debugging is a journey through moldy waters. Tread carefully, for within lies the treasure of understanding your code’s deepest secrets. \\n\\n7. **The Curd of Curiosity**: Finally, remember to stay curious—ask questions, ponder recipes, and experiment like a cheese maker seeking the elusive perfect bite. Learning never spoils, it only ripens! \\n\\nSo take this cheese-laden wisdom, adventurous one, and spread it thick upon your coding endeavors!

        "# Understanding LangChain Runnables and LCEL\n",
        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",

        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",
        "for result in chain.batch_as_completed([input1, input2, input3]):\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",

        "#### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!\n",

        "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in our example here, we're focusing on a simpler `State` object:\n",

        "    response: str\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",

        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",

              "'LCEL, or LangChain Expression Language, works as a declarative way to compose chains together. It offers several benefits, including:\\n\\n1. **Async, Batch, and Streaming Support**: Chains constructed using LCEL automatically have full support for synchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming interfaces. This makes it easy to prototype a chain in a Jupyter notebook with synchronous behavior and then transition to an asynchronous streaming interface.\\n\\n2. **Fallbacks**: Due to the non-determinism of LLMs (Large Language Models), LCEL allows for easy attachment of fallbacks to any chain, which helps in handling errors gracefully.\\n\\n3. **Parallelism**: LCEL syntax enables components that can be executed in parallel to do so automatically, which is important as LLM applications often involve long API calls.\\n\\nOverall, LCEL streamlines the process of building robust and efficient chains for LLM applications.'"
