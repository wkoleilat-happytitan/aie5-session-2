            "The best way to write a loop in Python depends on the specific situation and what you're trying to achieve. However, I can share some general best practices that can help you write clean and efficient loops.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. **Use `for` Loops for Iterating Over Sequences**\n",
            "When you want to iterate over a list, tuple, or any iterable, a `for` loop is often the most concise and straightforward way to do it. For example:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
            "for number in numbers:\n",
            "    print(number)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. **Use `while` Loops for Conditional Iteration**\n",
            "If you need to continue looping until a certain condition is met, a `while` loop can be a good choice:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "count = 0\n",
            "while count < 5:\n",
            "    print(count)\n",
            "    count += 1\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. **Avoid Nested Loops When Possible**\n",
            "Nested loops can make code harder to read and can lead to performance issues. If you find yourself needing to nest loops, consider alternative solutions such as list comprehensions or using built-in functions like `map` or `filter`.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. **Keep Loop Bodies Simple**\n",
            "Try to keep the code inside the loop concise and focused on a single task. This improves readability and maintainability. If a loop body becomes complex, consider breaking it out into a separate function.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. **Use Enumerate for Index Tracking**\n",
            "If you need to keep track of the index of the items you're looping through, use `enumerate()`:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
            "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
            "    print(f\"{index}: {fruit}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. **Leverage List Comprehensions**\n",
            "For operations that can be expressed as a transformation of a list, consider using list comprehensions, which are often more Pythonic and can make your code cleaner:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 7. **Use `break` and `continue` Wisely**\n",
            "You can use `break` to exit a loop early or `continue` to skip to the next iteration, but use these sparingly; overusing them can make the logic more difficult to follow.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 8. **Consider Using Iterators**\n",
            "For large datasets, consider using iterators, generators, or libraries like `itertools` to manage memory efficiently.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Example Summary\n",
            "Here’s a simple example combining some of the best practices:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Using a for loop with enumerate and list comprehension\n",
            "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
            "\n",
            "squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]\n",
            "for index, number in enumerate(squared_numbers):\n",
            "    print(f'Index {index} has squared value: {number}')\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",

              "{'response': \"The 'Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem' refers to a situation where a CEO or startup founder, who has a strong background in a particular function (like product management, sales, or marketing), hires a weak executive to manage that same function. This often occurs because the CEO struggles to let go of the role they were successful in and may prefer to have a less competent executive in place so they can retain control and continue to be the prominent figure in that area. The term is named after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who, despite being a successful television executive, oversaw a period when ABC fell to fourth place in the ratings. Eisner's claim that he could turn ABC around if he had more time illustrates the tendency of leaders to underestimate the challenges of effectively managing areas outside their direct expertise.\",\n",
